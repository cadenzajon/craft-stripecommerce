# Stripe Commerce for Craft CMS

A session cart and Stripe Checkout for Craft CMS 5. Your products and prices live in Stripe; this plugin syncs them into Craft, holds a cart in the session, and hands off to Stripe Checkout. No Craft Commerce license, no JavaScript framework, no build step.

It builds on the free [`craftcms/stripe`](https://plugins.craftcms.com/stripe) plugin, which syncs your catalog. This plugin adds the cart and the checkout.

## Requirements

- Craft CMS 5.6+
- [`craftcms/stripe`](https://plugins.craftcms.com/stripe) 1.3+
- PHP 8.2+
- A Stripe account

## Install

```bash
composer require cadenzajon/craft-stripecommerce
php craft plugin/install stripe-commerce
```

Set your Stripe secret key in `.env` (the official plugin reads it):

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
```

## Quick start

Three steps: sync your catalog, add a cart button, add a checkout button. No configuration required.

**1. Sync products and prices from Stripe:**

```bash
php craft stripe-commerce/sync
```

**2. Add-to-cart button on a product page** (products are `craftcms/stripe` elements):

```twig
<form method="post">
  {{ csrfInput() }}
  {{ actionInput('stripe-commerce/cart/add') }}
  {{ hiddenInput('productId', product.id) }}
  <button>Add to cart</button>
</form>
```

**3. A cart page with a checkout button:**

```twig
{% for item in craft.stripeCart.items %}
  {{ item.product.title }} × {{ item.qty }}
{% endfor %}

<form method="post">
  {{ csrfInput() }}
  {{ actionInput('stripe-commerce/checkout') }}
  <button>Check out</button>
</form>
```

That's the whole store. Each product sells at its default Stripe price, and Stripe Checkout handles payment, address, and shipping.

## Cart

`craft.stripeCart` in Twig:

- `items` — cart rows, each with `product`, `price`, and `qty`
- `count` — total quantity
- `isEmpty`

Actions (POST `productId` and `qty`; they redirect back, or return JSON when the request sends `Accept: application/json`):

- `stripe-commerce/cart/add`
- `stripe-commerce/cart/update`
- `stripe-commerce/cart/remove`
- `stripe-commerce/cart/clear`

## Checkout

`stripe-commerce/checkout` turns the cart into a Stripe Checkout Session and redirects the customer to Stripe. After payment they return to your success URL, and the cart clears.

Everything below is optional. Configure it in `config/stripe-commerce.php`:

```php
return [
    'checkout' => [
        'successUrl' => 'shop/thanks?session={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}',
        'cancelUrl' => 'shop/cart',
        'shippingCountries' => ['US', 'CA'],   // collect a shipping address
        'shippingOptions' => ['shr_123'],       // Stripe shipping rate IDs
        'allowPromotionCodes' => true,
    ],
];
```

Two events let a site module hook in:

- `beforeCheckout` — modify the line items or session params before they go to Stripe
- `orderCompleted` — fires on the `checkout.session.completed` webhook, with the session payload

## Shipping and tax

Stripe handles both; the plugin computes neither.

Create shipping rates in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/shipping-rates) (flat amounts, free shipping, delivery estimates), then list their IDs in `checkout.shippingOptions`. Stripe shows them at checkout, the customer picks one, and the cost is added to the total. Enable [Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/checkout) for automatic tax, including tax on shipping.

Stripe's built-in shipping rates are a fixed amount per order. If you need rates that change with the delivery address or order total (for example free shipping over $50, or weight-based pricing), compute a rate in a `beforeCheckout` handler — your handler has the cart and can set `shipping_options` on the session params. Stripe's own [dynamic shipping options](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/custom-shipping-options) go further but require embedded checkout rather than the hosted redirect this plugin uses.

## Sync

```bash
php craft stripe-commerce/sync
```

Pulls every product and price from Stripe. Safe to re-run. To keep the catalog current automatically, subscribe a webhook once:

```bash
php craft stripe-commerce/webhooks/subscribe https://your-site.com/stripe/webhooks/handle
```

This creates the endpoint on Stripe and stores the signing secret where the official plugin expects it. Also available: `stripe-commerce/webhooks/status` and `stripe-commerce/webhooks/unsubscribe`.

## Pricing tiers (optional)

By default there are no tiers: every product sells at its Stripe default price. Turn tiers on only when a product needs more than one price for different customers — for example retail and wholesale.

Give each product one price per tier in Stripe, tagged with price metadata (default key `tier`):

- the retail price gets metadata `tier` = `retail`
- the wholesale price gets metadata `tier` = `wholesale`

Then define the tiers in `config/stripe-commerce.php`:

```php
return [
    'tiers' => [
        'retail' => ['default' => true],
        'wholesale' => ['accessCode' => getenv('WHOLESALE_CODE')],
    ],
];
```

The `default` tier applies to everyone. Other tiers activate per session in one of three ways:

- **Access code** — POST to `stripe-commerce/tiers/activate` with an `accessCode` field. Works on Craft Solo, which has no front-end users. POST to `stripe-commerce/tiers/deactivate` to revert.
- **User group** (Craft Pro) — add `'userGroup' => 'trade'` to a tier; members of that group get it automatically.
- **`resolveTier` event** — for anything else (IP allowlist, signed URL, time window).

In Twig, `craft.stripeCart.tier` is the active tier handle and `craft.stripeCart.priceFor(product)` returns the tier-resolved price. Checkout uses the active tier's prices automatically.

To store the tier on a different metadata key, set `priceTierMetadataKey`.

## Events

- `cadenzajon\stripecommerce\services\Tiers::EVENT_RESOLVE_TIER` — override the resolved pricing tier
- `cadenzajon\stripecommerce\services\Checkout::EVENT_BEFORE_CHECKOUT` — modify line items and session params
- `cadenzajon\stripecommerce\services\Checkout::EVENT_ORDER_COMPLETED` — a checkout completed (from the webhook)
